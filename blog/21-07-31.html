	    <h3>Feeling the Future</h3>
	    
	    <p>I saw this study recently about percieving things that are not apparent in space or time (like perceiving things in the future) and thought it sounded ridiculous. The study is called <a href="https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/features/psp-a0021524.pdf">Feeling the Future</a>: Experimental Evidence for Anomalous Retroactive Influences on Cognition and Affect. It's written by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Bem">Daryl Bem</a>, a recognized social psychologist from Cornell. The study takes a look at some of the elements of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parapsychology">Parapsychology</a> (the study of alleged psychic phenomena) including telepathy, precognition and premonition. These phenomena are also referred to as "Extrasensory Perception". While experiments of this nature are usually written of as psuedoscience (34% of academic psychologists consider ESP to be impossible), this study makes a compelling case that you can influence/predict the future to a certain extent.</p>

	    <p>The study consists of nine experiments, but I'll focus on a couple that I found especially interesting. The first experiment, titled: "Precognitive Detection of Erotic Stimuli" is supposed to test whether erotic stimuli in particular can lend itself to precognition. Earlier studies had suggested that participants could anticipate erotic or negative stimuli without any warning. The experiment consists of people being shown two curtains and asked which one the erotic image was behind. However, the location of the images is randomly determined after the participant makes their choice (because otherwise they could be somehow reading the location in the present). The results across 100 sessions showed that "participants correctly identified the future position of the erotic pictures significantly more frequently than the 50% hit rate expected by chance: 53.1%". While 3.1% is not a huge amount, it is statistically significant because of the amount of trials that were run. There were no differences between the sexes, but Bem correlates extraversion with the likelihood of predicting the correct picture. This difference is explained in the study by "the extravert’s susceptibility to boredom and a tendency to seek out stimulation." The implication of these results is kind of ridiculous, that people can "predict" the future if it means they will reveal a sexual image.</p>

	    <p>After the results of this experiment, Bem spends some time explaining the mechanism behind the random number generator that chooses the location of the picture (because the validity of the results is dependent on the randomness of the RNG). There are two categories of RNG machines. Pseudo-random Number Generators are computer programs that use a mathematical algorithm to generate a new number from the previous number (the initial number being the "seed"). They are psuedo-random because once the seed is picked all future numbers are already determined. On the other hand, hardware RNGs use a physical process (ex. radioactive decay) to generate a number. This is more "random" in the sense that the results are not predetermined. However, Bem explains that both methods can fail some mathematical tests used to assess the randomness of an RNG (neither are perfect). Bem gives four possibilities that explain how people could choose the correct location of the image more than average:</p>

	    <ol>
		<li>Precognition: The participant knows/predicts the future</li>
		<li>Clarivoyance: The particapant can see present information stored on the computer</li>
		<li>Psychokinesis: The particpant is influencing the choice of the RNG</li>
		<li>Bad RNG: The RNG contains patterns which coincidentally match up with particpants' responses</li>
	    </ol>

	    <p>The choice of RNG rules out different possibilites. If a PRNG is used, it could be clarivoyance because the random numbers are already predetermined and in the computer (but psychokinesis is not possible because they are determined). If a hardware RNG is used, it can't be clarivoyance because the numbers haven't been selected but participants could be influencing it in real time (psychokinesis). However, the same results were obtained wheteher using a PRNGs or hardware RNGs which rules out both possiblites. So now just option 1 (Precognition) and 4 (Bad RNG) are left. To rule out the possibility of Bad RNG, Bem redoes the experiment with the RNG acting as the particpant and the location chooser. If the RNG had patterns, they would line up with each other and produce a result far off from 50%. However, "The hit rates were 49.5%, 50.4%, and 49.5% for the internal PRNG, the Marsaglia PRNG, and the Araneus Alea I RNG" which shows that the RNGs used were random enough to produce a valid result, leaving precognition as the only remaining possibility. As I've said before, the conclusion of this experiment is crazy. I don't know enough about psychology or social experiments to know if this methodology was sound or not, but the journal it's published in (Journal of Personality and Social Psychology) is pretty reputable.</p>

	    <p>The other experiment that I found especially cool was experiment 8: "Retroactive Facilitation of Recall I". This one starts off with a quote from Alice in Wonderland, the White Queen talks about her memory working both ways, telling Alice: "It’s a poor sort of memory that only works backwards." The experiment tests whether practicing writing out words after being tested on remembering them retroactively improves your recall. Participants were shown 48 common nouns in groups of three and then given a surprise memory test afterwards. In the memory test, the participants were asked to type out as many words as they could remember (in any order). Then, after the memory test, participants were told to practice typing out some of the words. The results showed that people had a higher rate of recalling the words they would end up practicing later. This is an expressed as a percentage ranging from -100% to +100%. -100% would mean that all non-practice words were recalled but none of the practice words were recalled and +100% would be the opposite. The weighted mean percentage across all trials was 2.27%, but it was way higher for extraverts at 6.46%. This trend of ESP working better with extraverts is repeated across the other studies as well.</p>

	    <p>After all the experiments, Bem provides some concluding thoughts on ESP and the value of the results. Bem theorizes that if ESP is real, then it would propogate because it is evolutionarily advantageous. If you could sometimes sense future danger then you would probably survive longer than your friends (this is tested in Experiment 2: Precognitive Avoidance of Negative Stimuli). A comparison is drawn between ESP and quantum mechanics, in the sense that both are completely different from other systems we have developed to model reality. For example, particles can become entangled such that the state of one is dependent on the state of the other, even when they are separated by large distances. This is completely contrary to the way we expect things to work on a more macro level. Similarly, retroactive influence on a person's memory sounds equally unbelievable. The last section of the paper is titled: "On Believing Impossible Things". He gives another passage from Alice in Wonderland, the White Queen reponds to Alice "When I was your age, I always did it for half-an-hour a day. Why, sometimes I’ve believed as many as six impossible things before breakfast." Bem says "Unlike the White Queen, I do not advocate believing impossible things. But perhaps this article will prompt the other 66% of academic psychologists to raise their posterior probabilities of believing at least one anomalous thing before breakfast."</p>

	    <p>Unsurprisingly, Feeling the Future has recieved alot of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daryl_Bem#%22Feeling_the_Future%22_controversy">criticism</a>. Several academics looked at the study and found flaws with the methodology (although rebuttals have been published against the criticism). Two other cognitive psychologists, Jeffery Rouder and Richard Moery published a statistical <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-011-0088-7">analysis</a> of the study. They concluded that "while the evidence provided by Bem is certainly worthy of notice, it should not be sufficient to sway an appropriately skeptical reader. We remain unconvinced of the viability of ESP." Additionally, several unsuccessful attempts have been made to replicate the results Bem got in the study.</p>

	    <p>After looking through all this, I don't really know what to believe. It seems impossible that ESP could be real (wouldn't it have been widely documented by now?), but I don't think the study was falsified or anything. Due to the availability of all these studies on the internet I'm sure you can find a study to support almost any opinion/result. Either way this one is pretty interesting and I enjoyed reading it. I know many people wholeheartedly believe in ESP and psychic abilities, just by the amount of physic/tarot card reading places you can find around any major city. I wonder if these people read about it and come to believe in it or have some specific experience that convinces them that it's legit. The wikipedia page for <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychic">psychic</a> says that in a 2005 Gallup Poll of the US, 41% of people believed in ESP. This number seems really high to me, but I guess I don't hang out with people who would be into that sort of thing.</p>
